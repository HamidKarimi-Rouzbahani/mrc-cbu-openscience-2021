## Introduction

The workshop aims at showing the benefits of data sharing.
Data sharing is the process of making research data available for wider dissemination. For a primer on data sharing, visit https://osf.io/wp4zu/ .


> ## prerequisites
> Have an account on Open Science Framework
{: .prereq}

Tips to use Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/ ) as a (private) repository for data collection and as a public tool for data sharing are also included

Participants are asked about their experience with data sharing and OSF in particular: what they do, which benefits do they find in that, which flaws do they perceive.
